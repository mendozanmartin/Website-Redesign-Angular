            Every year, the production of waste increases exponentially.
            Moreover, it is estimated that humankind currently produces two
            billion tonnes of waste per year between 7.6 billion people. The
            people that are affected most about this trend will be the
            generations that come after us.

            Our Solution
          </h4>
          <p class="fs-20 text-black">
            As of right now, recycling is still the best method for managing
            waste and so we have developed an educational app that will
            encourage the younger generation to recycle. Our goal is to promote
            environmental awareness to the generations that come after us. Using
            AI image classification, you are able to take a photo with your
            mobile device and it can determine whether something is recyclable
            or not. To target the younger generation, our aim is to partner with
            big organizations to sponsor the act of recycling. Similar to how
            the LCBO reimburses for alcohol cans, we can partner with government
            organizations or other companies who want to carry out environmental
            initiatives. So people who take pictures of recyclable items will be
            rewarded currency (maybe even companies like Cineplex for scene
            points?)

          <h4 class="mt-4">The User Experience</h4>
          <p class="fs-20 text-black">
            People who pass by a Promptu billboard (mural) will be invited to
            visit a website on their mobile device via short URL, NFC or QR
            code. On the mural, they will see a prompt such as "What's your
            favourite animal". Through their phone, the user will be able to
            answer that question and in turn receive 3 drawings sourced from
            Google's Quickdraw dataset. Once they pick one of the three
            drawings, they will see their drawing pop up on the big screen with
            a fact about the animal. On your mobile screen, you will be invited
            to take action. The action can come in the form of an email
            subscription, online donations, visiting a website, signing a
            petition + more. Once a mural becomes full of drawings, the screen
            will be captured and refreshed (to be stored on external
            website/social media).
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Next Steps</h4>
          <p class="fs-20 text-black">
            We aim to enhance the user experience by integrating a social call
            to action. Ideally, the finished product would include an option to
            continue the conversation on social media by sharing the mural via
            Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Utilizing the #ImpactfulPrompts
            hashtag will generate a beautiful feed of unique murals categorized
            by topics.
